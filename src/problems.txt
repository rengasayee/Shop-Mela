Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports. Check the render method of `App`.

Failed to compile.

Attempted import error: 'RootLayout' is not exported from './layouts/RootLayout' (imported as 'RootLayout').      
ERROR in ./src/App.js 15:34-44
export 'RootLayout' (imported as 'RootLayout') was not found in './layouts/RootLayout' (possible exports: default)

webpack compiled with 1 error

Soln : In App.js, RootLayout was imported as import { RootLayout } from './layouts/RootLayout';
When export default used, no curly brackets required.

correct one : import RootLayout from './layouts/RootLayout';

Unexpected Application Error!
Unexpected token 'N', "Not Found" is not valid JSON
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'N', "Not Found" is not valid JSON

Why this happens ? Bcoz json-server is not installed or endpoint was not created.
